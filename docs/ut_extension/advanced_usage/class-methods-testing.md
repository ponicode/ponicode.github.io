# Class Methods Testing

Ponicode Unit Test Extension supports method testing. As usual select the desired method and open the webview with a right click to `Ponicode: Unit Test`. The **Ponicode Webview** appears on the right side of the screen with a new section at the top called **Before Each**.

The before each section lets you instantiate the context before each test.
