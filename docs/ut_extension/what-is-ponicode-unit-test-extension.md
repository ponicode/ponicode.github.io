# What is Ponicode Unit Test
Ponicode Unit Test is an IDE extension that allows you to automatically generate unit tests for all your functions in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python.

It consists of a Graphical User Interface:
- To create unit tests intuitively in a few clicks.
- Generate unit tests thanks to Artificial Intelligence.
- Transform data listened to from the runtime into unit tests.

At the moment, Ponicode is only available on VS Code.
