# Run Ponicode On Your Own Project

## JavaScript
To generate tests for your JavaScript files, you do not need any configuration.

In case you need the `History` section to start, you'll need to install the `ponicode` package via npm
```bash
npm install -g ponicode@latest
```

Additional packages might be needed to run test cases in the webview
```

```

## Python

> To run the tests you'll need to install `pytest` and `pytest-mock` on your Python virtual environment

# Use pip
pip install pytest pytest-mock
# Use conda
conda install pytest pytest-mock
```
