# What Do We Support?

## IDEs
Ponicode is today present on a single IDE : **VS Code**.
More to come.

## Languages
For the moment, Ponicode can be used for the following languages:
- **JavaScript** (**CommonJS**, **ES6**, **Node**, **JSX**)
- **TypeScript**
- **Python**
- 
We are working on expanding the languages and libraries we support and focusing on **React** + **Redux**.

## Testing Frameworks
The testing frameworks used by Ponicode are :
- For **JavaScript** et **TypeScript** code testing: **Jest** and **rewire**
- For **Python**: **pyTest** and **pytest-mock**

Making Ponicode useful to more and more developers is very important to us. Join the [Ponicode Community Slack](https://ponicode-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-fiq4fhkg-DE~a_FkJ7xtiZxW7efyA4Q#/) and let us know which language/framework we should be focusing on next!
